This code reads constant price GDP data, cleans and converts it to numeric form, and treats 
each row as a sector across multiple years. For every sector, it computes the mean GDP, 
standard deviation, and coefficient of variation to summarize the level and volatility of economic 
performance over time.

USED DATA : "FINAL GDP - CONSTANT.xlsx"



```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
df <- read_excel("FINAL GDP - CONSTANT.xlsx")

# Remove empty rows
df <- df %>% filter(!is.na(Item))

# Force numeric conversion
df_numeric <- df %>%
  mutate(across(-Item, ~as.numeric(.)))

# Select numeric year columns
years <- df_numeric %>% select(-Item) %>% names()

# Compute Mean, SD, CV
results <- df_numeric %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    Mean = mean(c_across(all_of(years)), na.rm = TRUE),
    SD   = sd(c_across(all_of(years)), na.rm = TRUE),
    CV   = (SD / Mean) * 100
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Sector = Item, Mean, SD, CV)
